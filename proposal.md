Kronos - Unleash Your Potential in Valorant

  Kronos is a website designed to get beginner and intermediate players 
into Valorant. It is composed of 3 main sections, with an informational section
about the different agents and the strategies best paired with them, a trainer 
section with an aim and spray control trainer, and a section about the optimal 
strategies for each map in Valorant.

  Javascript will be used in order to switch shown content using HTML DOM. 
Javascript will also be used to program in the aim and spray control trainers.

  The wireframes are in the assets folder of this glitch project.
